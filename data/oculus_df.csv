Share with the rest of the subreddit what games and experiences you've been enjoying recently.

How did you come across the game, what were your first impressions like, what did you like about it and most importantly, would you recommend the rest of us to try it or to stay away?  

Here are a couple of suggestions to follow when posting:

- Please put names of the games/experiences **in bold** for easier skim reading.

- Keep in mind that this is all about personal impressions and opinions so if someone didn't enjoy your favourite title feel free to discuss why but do so in a civil manner. No harassing someone for having a different opinion.  

- **Use spoiler tags** when discussing game's plot as to not ruin it for someone who hasn't played it yet.

- Upvote informative and well-written posts to encourage quality discussion.  
  
- Add a store link to the games.

Not bad, but there was only me &amp; a fellow from Japan. lol

Tje point is, the idea itself is quite sound.  

Now I understand why *all* tech conferences can't be in VR: 

most of the potential attendees probably won't have an HMD.

But a tech conference specifically *for* virtual reality, like, say,

oh I don't know ....  ""Facebook Connect 2"" perhaps?, 

absolutely at the very least should have a SOTA ""VR Only"" option for visitors.

They can even make it interactive after a fashion by having Carmack 

conduct his famous post-keynote ""Hallway Session"",including the ability 

to field questions from the audience through voicechat, just like IRL.

You'd *think* Facebook would be the masters of virtual conferences,

especially with things like ""Horizon"" &amp; ""Horizon Workrooms"" already 
under their belt, 

but alas, no ....  A 2D flatscreen in ""Venues"" just doesn't cut it, sadly.

I just wanted to make a post due to being very Upset with the way Oculus has dumped the Rift S for the Quest 2!

Dont get me wrong, I think the Quest 2 seems like a great HMD and I can see why that's where they are focussing on going forward! But.......

I have a Rift S

My Rift S cost £400

My Rift S was Bought 2 Years Ago 

And now it seems like my 2-year-old, £400 VR headset is being abandoned by Oculus, somewhat aggressively as well! I speak of course about Resident Evil 4 VR been exclusive to the Quest 2, Now I understand Platform exclusivity but locking Rift owners out of being able to play this game is just awful! I paid £400 2 years ago for an Oculus headset that now won't get any more games because?????? Why?

Obviously, any PCVR system would be able to play RE4VR as PCVR has more horsepower (depending on the PC) than a Quest 2! So why not have RE4 VR on the quest store for all their customers?

Are they just trying to get us all to buy the Quest 2?

Why don't I Just Buy a Quest 2?

There are 3 reasons I will not buy a Quest 2:

1. Im a PC VR Gamer, and the Quest 2 will be a slight downgrade to the Rift S
2. My Rift S is 2 years old and they have abandoned it, who is to say they won't just do the same with the Quest 2 (looks they have abandoned the Quest 1 as well)  I have no confidence in Oculus to support their hardware AT ALL
3. VR Headsets are too expensive to buy a new one every 2 years, My PS4 that cost a little less than my Rift lasted me 8 Years, Im cool with new headsets coming out but you can not cut off support for the older ones as soon as the new ones are out, especially when there is no technical reason that the older Headsets could not play  the newer games

And for that last reason, I don't think I would ever buy another oculus HMD if I'm only going to get 2 years of support out of it

The easy fix would be to realise a new Oculus game for PCVR &amp; Quest, supporting Quest &amp; Rift customers while still controlling the game's sales by only selling them via the Oculus store. Is this too much to ask? also, more availability would mean more game sales, wouldn't it?

Thank you for reading all this, I really mean that 

I would like to know what you think! I want to hear what other VR players think or this and what Oculus have to say for themselves

I know that the transmission limit for HDMI cables is 50+ feet so that's fine, but the transmission limit for usb 2 is ~16ft and usb 3 is ~6ft. Active repeater cables for that length are kind of expensive, so I was wondering whats the lowest cost option I can have while still maintaining decent quality. So here's my questions that resulted from this, any experience/expertise is appreciated.

1) Can 3 sensors + 1 headset worth of data be passed through a single USB cable? If not, how many ports would be needed minimum? 
2) Is there a way to pass USB data over Cat5/6/6e? That cable type has a wicked length limit, so being able to pass USB data over it would minimize cable clutter and be overall simpler.

There are both red USB ports and USB-c port on my motherboard, and I am wondering if using a USB-c to USB-c link cable is always better than using a compatible USB-c to USB type A cable. I can't seem to find anyone doing a comparison between these 2 options. There are two red USB ports and only one Type-C port on the motherboard and C to A cable is more general purpose so if the two are the same in performance I am thinking buying a C to A cable.

On the other hand I have successfully connected my Quest 2 with my PC wirelessly using a Wifi 6 router and the connection seems solid without too much latency. Do I still want to buy a Link cable? Or will I be just fine running wireless and using the provided charging cable for sitting VR use? Also now in late 2021 is it still necessary to buy Virtual Desktop?

So I posted about my Rift-S about a month ago. Long story short, it died. I got the dreaded ""No Display Port Connection"" Error and that was that. It's gone. Since they don't make the Rift-S anymore, After a month of trying solutions that sadly didn't work, the Oculus Support guys just said ""buy a quest 2"". So here I am, thinking about buying a Quest 2. I've looked up articles and reviews but I have a couple questions still that I hope people here could answer.
1. A Quest 2 with a PCVR cable is pretty much the same setup as the Rift-S correct? How's the performance? Does it differ?
2. Can I play my quest 2 exclusive games on my PC somehow? I am excited for Resident Evil 4 VR, as you know it is going to be a Quest 2 exclusive for now. Is there a way I could buy it on the quest 2, plug my PCVR cable in and play it on my PC? Maybe have better processing power? is that even a thing?
3. I've seen a lot of talk about the default headstrap and some lawsuit or something. What's that about and how is the default headstrap? I know people say to change them out immediately, what do you use?

My CV1 doesn't get used much anymore, I don't have a whole lot of space, and it's a hassle to get the cables out and set it all up, so I get lazy with it and don't bother, meaning it hardly gets used anymore.  I love gaming though, and love VR, but life gets in the way sometimes.

My CV1 is powered by a gaming laptop that's a few years old, with an i7-7700HQ, 32GB RAM, and a 6GB 1060 (this laptop version is a little underpowered compared to PC).  So I'm reluctant to buy new games that would struggle to run.

I know the Quest 2 is less powerful, but is also self contained, so its easier to pull out and switch on, and can be tethered to the laptop if wanted.

So this leaves me with a few questions:

1. Is my 6GB 1060, i7-7700HQ, 32GB RAM laptop powerful enough to tether, are there significant overheads doing this?
2. I assume all games I've bought for the CV1 will also work on the Quest 2 when tethered?
3. Do games like Beat Saber need to be bought again for the Quest 2, or are they considered to be the same platform, therefore will work untethered too?
4. The Oculus Link cable retails at £90, but I can get cheaper alternatives that claim to be compatible for around £10.  Are they actually just as good, or do they have lower bandwidth and wont work as well?
5. In reality, how long does a full charge last when gaming?
6. Is there anything else I need to consider?

I've looked online and on here for possible solutions to this problem, but nothing has helped and I've tried a few things already.

The headset was working perfectly fine and I did my usual AirLink connection (it's the only way I use my Quest 2) and everything was suddenly very bright with some compression, even when I try a regular wired Link connection, it's the exact same. I attached a video of my Oculus home on pc which it's a bit hard to see the problem, but it's usually not this bright to the point the colors are washed out. It seems to be fine on the Quest 2 itself and only happens when connected to the PC. It has been this way since the 19th, worked perfectly fine the previous day.

If anyone could suggest something else I could try, it'd be very appreciated. I've also contacted support and I'm waiting for another response from them.

My router isn’t the issue — I have a nice speedy AC router with all the settings optimized.

I’ve spent countless hours scouring threads on a dozen different websites and I’ve tried all the solutions:

-	Adjusting settings in ODT and OTT
-	Adjusting settings in the Oculus desktop app and SteamVR
-	Switching to a different USB port
-	Multiple versions of AMD graphics drivers (currently on 21.4.1 which seems to be the most reliable) with clean uninstalls using DDU
-	Adjusting BIOS settings
-	Moving my GPU to a different PCIe port

I even did a full reformat of Windows which was the only thing that actually *seemed* to work… I got a whole 45 minutes of smooth gameplay in Alyx, then I decided to try Squadrons and the same thing started happening.

-Quest 2 will be the only device connected, so it doesn't need a ton of antennaes or fancy multi-connection tech

-Quest 2 will never be more than 10 feet away and will have line of sight, so huge distance and ability to penetrate obstructions isn't necessary

I have a problem with my Oculus Quest 2 which started happening recently.

The Quest 2 is mainly used to play VRChat, connected with a link cable to a computer.  
Everything was running fine for two weeks.  
Because I had technical issues, I had to reinstall the Oculus App on my PC again.  
After the I reinstalled the program, the problem started happening:

The Quest 2 uses **way more** battery, eventhough it's connected via link cable.  
By ""way more"" I mean, that it goes all the way from 100% to 0% in less than three hours.  
It used to last around 8 hours.

Any idea what the causes could be?  


**Additional information**:

1) I used the same USB-port which I used before when it worked (USB 3.0).

2) AirLink is not active, it's a wired connection between headset and PC.

3) It is not the official Oculus cable, but it used to work for two weeks.

The website stated that they processed and shipped returns within about two weeks, so cool, I'd have my headset back in no time!

Sadly, it's almost two months later and I'm pretty sure that I'll never see my headset again. Oculus Support who started out being very responsive no longer replies to my messages asking for an update, an eta, or at least a description of the problem. It's been weeks since they replied to me. The Oculus Support chat bot no longer connects to a human so that avenue was cut off. Oculus doesn't publish a phone number so I can't call them. I guess I could drive to California and show up at their office, but short of that there's literally no other was I can get ahold of them. If you check out the Better Business Bureau page for Oculus you'll see my story repeated over and over by other Oculus users.

So I've come to the conclusion that Mark Z. just stole the damn thing and I'm not going to ever see it again. I can say for certain that I won't be buying another Oculus product.

Even games like Gorn that actually have a native Rift version. So I'm having to resort to opening directly from Steam VR which can lead to performance and sometimes compatibility issues. 

 
I should say I have that I have Unknown sources ticked in my oculus settings and have tried uninstalling and reinstalling both all my launchers (Viveport, oculus home, steam VR) and my games. 


I have also tried adding the games manually via the plus button in the library tab in the oculus flat screen app but I still run into those performance and compatibility issues.

A little bit of background.

I recently gave up my 9-5 job to focus on work life balance and have been running a modestly successful e-commerce store selling a product I developed.  My business is profitable but don’t see if being able to expand significantly beyond its current state so looking to diversify as currently have a significant amount of free time.

My eldest has been wanting a VR party for his birthday this year and we have been looking at various options.  Most are priced around the £200-250 for 10 people mark which is reasonable enough but when we ask to have the party at our own venue the price goes up significantly.

As a result we are considering purchasing 3 or 4 vr headsets and hosting the event ourself and then offering VR sessions/parties in people’s homes.

Based on the retail cost of a Quest 2 I believe we could run profitable at home/customers venue sessions for around the £50-100 mark, undercutting our competition and giving people an alternative to the VR cafes/studios.  

I would be looking at purchasing between 3 and 6 headsets initially and am trying to find out the following...

1. Would I need to purchase each game six times.  I’m aware there is a degree of account sharing available but not sure about the limits of this.

2. Do VR generally games permit commercial use or do separate licences need to be purchased.

3. Beyond the cost of the units, display devices and usually business costs (insurance etc) is there anything else I am missing from my calculations?

Is it just me or using bows in the quest 2 is kind of broken? normally when you aim a bow you put the hand that holds the arrow sort of behind your head , but this this because of the tracking in the quest 2 is not possible, as the controller goes out of the tracking range of the cameras, making it very hard to align the arrow the way we want.

One way around it is to put the right hand ahead of the headset , but this causes the arrow to shoot with less force. In skyrim they sort of fixed by fixing the array 90 degrees to the bow

Is there any solution?

When I stream from my desktop using Air Link, I've noticed that there seems to be some kind of ""predictive tracking"" going on which makes it impossible to reliably aim in shooters, vs Virtual Desktop which is much more snappy.

I ran a bunch of shooting tests using RoboRecall as a baseline. Test 1, I drew my gun from hip and immediately throw it as quick as possible. Test 2, I use a full pistol mag going from one target to another as fast as I can.

I was roughly 80% more accurate with Virtual Desktop because there's no ""predictive tracking"". Why does Air Link work like that? Is there a setting in ODT I can use to disable it?

Also, what streaming settings do you use with Air Link?

I was able to use it without any problems until a month or so ago when the blackscreen issue first began. Was okay at first since It only happened every 4 to 6 hours until it started to get worse and worse. I'm now at the point where 15 minutes is basically the maximum playtime I can get. Its not the usual blackscreen, it goes like this: Complete visual pause of everything, blackscreen, long beep, static noise, orange LED. 

I've tried all these things:
Reinstalling oculus
Resetting oculus
Universal Serial Bus
Checking the cable itself for any faults
Public Test Channel
Updated GPU Driver
Checked for windows updates

I've heard it could be a problem with the cable but It's been out of stock for a while. People also say I should reinstall windows, but thats such a big task and I dont see how that would be the problem. I'm also going to purchase a USB Power Hub and see if that works. A lot of people said that the problem occurs because the pc cannot produce enough power to support the headset but then It begs the question why did it get worse overtime and how come it only started a month ago? 

Question for Oculus: My warrenty still applies to the headset and I was wondering if all else fails, is this something I can get a replacement for or no?

We fixed that with… just one button! 😄

A super simple **One-Button Campaign**! You can try your first puzzle directly from the first level menu if you never played, and once you finish you will be offered a new puzzle to try next. **This update is going to be really nice for new players or when you don't know what to play.**

This mini-campaign starts now in Peco Peco with 22 puzzles from 7 pieces to 200 pieces!

If you finish the campaign, we would be super happy if you'd come brag a little and tell everybody about it in the Peco Peco discord: [https://discord.pecopecogame.com/](https://discord.pecopecogame.com/)",True,False,False,oculus,t5_2uni5,381036,public,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/QysGg8gMJV9-YW4uvsaKOY4cOHIEOMmn9piXsDJKLd4.jpg,"Peco Peco new campaign mode: 22 puzzles to play, one-button simple access",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/potahs/peco_peco_new_campaign_mode_22_puzzles_to_play/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,"{'1kn5bi9azon71': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '1kn5bi9azon71', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1kn5bi9azon71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca9cd95b2c0fa9b670d841543bd312a5f8e57700', 'x': 108, 'y': 91}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1kn5bi9azon71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5297d6b07a4ed30a4cfdf6539d04342111c53271', 'x': 216, 'y': 182}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1kn5bi9azon71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44f5b3a626b699b278d4168bbf354d683b480e61', 'x': 320, 'y': 270}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1kn5bi9azon71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d88587b6408ce799f220235982d71879d713de8', 'x': 640, 'y': 541}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1kn5bi9azon71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e92e6c9a4664a88b4eab6dde42364a30065f835', 'x': 960, 'y': 812}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1kn5bi9azon71.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23757cda0e56b8f2812fb57736706e571e88b13e', 'x': 1080, 'y': 913}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/1kn5bi9azon71.png?width=1312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecace109c2eeac87607f5fe5e8c6af505cc9580b', 'x': 1312, 'y': 1110}, 'status': 'valid'}}",118.0,140.0,,,

I'm a bit stumped as to why my Link isn't working. I have a Ryzen 5 3600 and a Radeon RX 5700 XT so I should be well into the ideal specifications for it.

When I load Oculus Link, I get a black screen with infinite loading. If I use my PC to start games like Phasmophobia, I get the audio from the game in the headset but no video. I have the Official Oculus Type-C to Type-C connector and it's plugged directly into my motherboard. I've reset my graphics drivers and wiped, and reinstalled them to no avail.

I'd like to use the native support a lot more than Virtual Desktop. Using VD is nice if I'm just browsing something, but games look like absolute ass. 

I've double checked and made sure that Air Link wasn't enabled. Air Link worked, in my experience, worse than Virtual Desktop so I won't use it. 

I'm just a bit stumped as to what to do next. One of my friends told me to update my VBIOS on my GPU.

It asked me to use the official Link Cable, which i don't have, so I used a charging usb-c to usb cable to install it and after i did, I connected the Airlink from my PC to my headset. I launched the AirLink thing but the only thing i saw was 3 dots, which didn't do anything but load. After i tried countless of times I removed my headset and saw that the headset had messed up all of the drivers for my logitech headphones, mouse and keyboard. Since i see that the R9 200 series isn't supported i am wondering if i should return the headset and look into getting one in the future, when I have the money to buy a new PC, or do some hack thing to make it work.

4. Paste the following code starting with ADB in to 'command to run box.
5. Disconnect your USB cable and press the power button on side of Q2 then press it again and you'll see the resolution is much clearer.
6. So long as your Q2 does not restart or run out of battery the resolution code will stay active.

Ever since moving to a new apartment, I've been having really bizarre issues with my Oculus where it seems that the software itself is causing my internet to become unstable, and even crash my Network Adapter's drivers.


Basically, the general flow of the issue is:

Start Oculus Software &gt; Start Steam VR &gt; Put on Headseat &gt; Internet Crashes


This can happen in slightly different orders too, like if I start up a game directly from Steam and have it load my Oculus software and Steam VR all at the same time, and as such, it seems that the connecting thread is that my internet crashes *when* I put my headset on. Not before, not after.

After the crash, the only solution is to close my Oculus Software entirely, and only then I can reconnect to my WiFi.

It's a really befuddling issue, especially given that I've, on rare occasions, been able to finagle the order in which I open things, and reconnect my internet while in-game, but this is wildly inconsistent, and I'm posting this after a night of not being able to get that to work at all.

It really shouldn't take me 40+ minutes each night just to get into VR, and sometimes not at all, because at some point the Oculus Software is deciding to just divebomb my internet drivers.

Any help on this is seriously appreciated. If it helps diagnose at all, this started right after moving and re-organizing my gaming PC's setup, including adding another extra monitor. These internet issues are solely on the side of my PC as the software causes the drivers to crash, since my router is still running fine and dandy and my phone connects just fine when Oculus crashes my computer's drivers.",True,False,False,oculus,t5_2uni5,379950,public,self,Oculus Software(?)

The tracking issue in question is my headset's positional tracking, and a static screen (shown in picture), what happens is that irl im moving around my room, but in-game it shows im not moving at all; my headset also doesn't track my controllers, they either appear where they were last tracked or appear clipping into each other directly bellow where my headset appears; Both my headset and controllers maintain rotational tracking. I don't know if it's the cord (would suck because the rift s lost support from oculus) or if it's my graphics card (radeon rx580), either way i don't want to replace anything. if anyone has a fix for this it would be much appreciated.

ISSUE:

DisplayPort connection wont recognize. Cant start up games as software says headset isnt connected. Always says displayport isnt connected, despite being in correctly.

ACTIONS TAKEN SO FAR, NONE FIXING THE ISSUE:

Checked Cable, All is well

USB Port is 3.0 or above and the hub is powered.

Did the timing trick where you unplug both the USB and display port, and stagger putting them back in.

Updated all drivers

Checked headset and GPU ports. All fine.

Did a clean boot of windows, and reinstalled oculus software.

However I thought about this: I have limited available space on my 120 Gb SSD disk (only 25 Gb free before Oculus app install), so I chose to install everything on my SATA. Would that be a problem? Should I upgrade my hard drive to get a bigger one?

Had fun with it for a couple months, playing SuperHot, Beat Saber, and a bunch of other Steam games. VR is amazing!

But it was not to last. I first ran into trouble when I tried playing Star Wars Squadrons in Steam, which crashed multiple times and was just generally buggy. That was around the first time I ran into the ""headset can't track movement,"" error, as well as the Rift S randomly disconnecting and suggesting it needed to be plugged into different USB 3.0 ports. From then on, virtually nothing worked, even when just trying to explore Oculus Home or play the tutorial games. ""Can't track sensors,"" etc. On the Devices tab, I always got the red X showing ""USB not connected,"" and sometimes the DisplayPort wouldn't connect either. No rhyme or reason to any of it, seemingly.

Scoured Reddit, Amazon, and old forums over the next couple of months trying all kinds of fixes. Opened an Oculus support ticket, emailed back and forth a few times after sending over all my system logs, but gave up when FB staff failed to give any suggestions I hadn't already tried. Don't have the option of switching USB 3.0 ports, as my PC only has one. Bought the Inateck USB 3.0 expansion card, but the Rift S didn't work with any of the ports despite other devices working fine when plugged in. Thought maybe the Rift S could work with my gaming laptop, but after researching, learned that USB-C -&gt; DisplayPort was not an option for me. Got incredibly frustrated. Didn't touch the headset for 3-4 months, during which I switched over to a Quest 2 and had a much easier time. 

Then, on a whim, I picked up the dusty Rift S this weekend, and realized my PC actually has 2 USB 3.0 ports, one of which was occupied by my external hard drive. Switched the Rift S with that port, and suddenly everything seems to work perfectly. Played VRChat for hours on Saturday and had a blast, with the only issue being my mic cutting out at one point. But other than that, the Rift S has continued to work fine with every other game I've tried.

My pc only has one port for the headset, so I cannot try another one. I have tried uninstalling and redownloading the software, booting into safe mode and wiping everything Oculus related, etc. 

The interesting thing is, I was in the public test channel, and when I switch it off, the Oculus downloads a 9 part update. That doesn’t fix anything. But, when I turn the public test channel off and then back on again, it redownloads that same update, and will continue to do so every time I switch the test channel off and back on again, leading me to think it’s something Oculus software related.

1: Virtual Desktop or Airlink?  


2: When using Virtual Desktop to use the quest 2 wirelessly, will I be able to change settings on a PCVR game like HF: Alyx, as I would normally do on a CV1, like changing the graphics from low to ultra?

1. For both kids to be playing at the same time, do we need to buy two systems?

2. What is the amount of physical gaming space required for most games? (Our living room is tight)

Framerate usually hovers between 110 and 120 fps with frequent drops to 80 fps.

Also in some games the framerate doesn't even get to 100 fps. The thing is I have a pretty good PC (RTX 3070 i7 10700KF) and both the GPU and the CPU never max out. GPU is usually at about 60% and CPU 40%. I've also noticed that my CPU frametimes are not great, I see some bad spikes.

This has always happened to me, but I recently changed my CPU so I thought it had more to do with the other CPU bottlenecking the 3070 than anything else. It's also been pretty long since I last tried playing wired, as it's pretty uncomfortable because the cable gets in the way and I can't physically turn which I really like, but I might give it a go later. Also as soon as I have some more time I'll record the FPS VR log so maybe you can see what's going on with that.

This happens in pretty much all the games, including those in an SSD. I'm using Virtual Desktop, 120Hz, medium settings.

\-Will games I purchased in the Oculus store work with the Quest 2 (I saw I Expect you to Die 2 released, and it said Rift and Rift S, but not Quest 2)  


\-Will games I purchased on Steam work with the Quest 2? I have lost a decent amount of weight doing VR and the main games I use for working out is Box VR, Thrill of the Fight, and Beat Saber. Regular games I play are Moss, Pavlov, I Expect you to Die, Project Wingman, and more but I figured this will give a rough idea.  


\-I'm assuming all that I need to make it work with my PC is the link cable? 99% of the time it will be used with my PC.  


\-I know the Quest 2 is mobile with a battery, but if I wanted to play idk, 5 hours on the Quest 2 with the link cable connected to the PC, would it provide enough power to keep the headset running?  


\-Are there accessories you'd recommend to make it a better experience? For the Rift I have all I ever bought was a new face plate and it made a huge difference.  


\-And lastly, is there anything I should know (tips, tricks, etc) vs the OG Rift?

I cant make a new account with the same name, I cant make an account with a fake name, I cant sign in to the one with my real data.

I have a WiFi 6 modem downstairs and a Google Wifi puck upstairs in the hallway next to my room. I have my PC hardwired from the modem, to the puck, then from the puck to my PC. I also use the puck to connect my quest 2 to so I can play PCVR games on Virtual Desktop. My quest and PC are the only two devices connected to that puck, and my Quest 2 is MAYBE 10ft at most from the puck. So I connect the two, launch Virtual Desktop, and everything is fine. It has a full strength 5ghz signal at 866mbps. All is fine until I launch a game and then all of the sudden its 300ms+ latency and &gt;20fps. I've tried changing the ""Desktop Bitrate"" and ""VR Bitrate"" in every possible combination, from the minimum to the maximum. I have SSW and ""Automatically Adjust Bitrate"" turned off. No difference. I've even tried moving my modem upstairs and plugging my PC directly into the modem, without going through the Google Pucks, and still nothing. My Download on my PC is 700, Upload is 40. Quest is 120 down, 40 up. I dont get it. Nothing I've seen in any posts have fixed my problems. 

I am quite frankly about to just say ""screw it"" and use a link cable. I have noticed that playing Pavlov Shack on my Quest natively, im still getting around 60fps. I'm not sure if that's because Pavlov Shack isn't an official Oculus Store game or what, but thats the only Quest game I've played since my problems started. I also lag a lot in the Oculus menus.

I've been having alot of problems with the Rift S trying to make it work again, it says the tracking isn't working ive tried everything on the internet to make it work but nothing seems to fix it.  


The strange thing is taht at first it was working fine i had sometimes the problem where i had to unplug/replug the usb but i could play.  


After 1 month or so without any use i started it and it wouldn't work anymore (stuck at 3 dots)  


I tried :  


Bought a Powered Usb hub

Switched usb/display ports   
Uninstall/Reinstall oculus app

Uninstall/Reinstall oculus usb driver  
Camera settings  
GPU updates  
Windows updates  
I even went as far as Removing my 2nd monitor and every usb hardware from my PC...  


So today i contacted the oculus suport and after a few things they told me to do nothing worked.  
In one of the last steps they told me to try to Reset my PC, but the thing is i'm really afraid to do this without knowing if there is a chance for this to work because i will lose most of my files/installed games etc... for something i'm not sure is worth trying  


So i'm asking for some of you who had similar problem to mine if after they did this step it started working again or was it pointless ?

Problem is, my Facebook account got locked and they won't let me back into my account. I have even sent in an ID to Facebook, but because my name on Facebook is a shortened version of my full legal name it didn't match perfectly. 

I was hoping that by contacting Oculus they would be able to resolve it, because what tech company doesn't have the ability to fix the accounts needed for their own technology? After talking with the first Support agent they informed me that was not the case. They took down all my information (which Facebook already has) and told me they would send it to Facebook. 

I had some follow up questions after the chat had ended so I started another one and got a different person. They were helpful at first but when I asked a question that they either couldn't answer or didn't know the answer to, they started giving me information that I never asked for. Then when I reiterated my question because they never answered me, they started exclaiming ""We have done all that we can!!"" and that I ""would have to wait 14 days like Ricardo told me to"".

At this point I felt that I was being treated rudely and unfairly for asking a simple question that they could have just replied ""I do not have that information"" to. Instead of dancing around it. So I asked to speak with a Supervisor, to which I was basically told no and that they were all too busy to speak with me. 

I didn't want to escalate. I literally just wanted help or at the very least information about what to expect.

My graphics card is pretty old (AMD Radeon R7 370) I know its old and not supposed to run VR, but its bugging me because when setting up the CV1 in the tutorial in the Oculus software, I can get pretty far in it, maybe 3-4 steps in (in the headset) and then it just goes black, and when I try and unplug it and re-plug it in or try troubleshoot it, it gives me some sort of glitch screen, different kind of blocks of different colors, sorta like missing textures in a video game, and I can't seem to get past this.

Why it's bugging me so much is because if my graphics card wasn't VR ready, then why can I run half of the tutorial flawlessly? And my GPU isn't even going above 50% in task manager, I overclocked the GPU and retried and I think it just made matters worse, my graphics card driver kept crashing and I repeatedly got the ""Driver timeout detected"" popup, closing Oculus software and turning the VR led to orange.

Here's some of the stuff you may need to know to help me figure out whats wrong,

My HDMI Port on my graphics card can be a little weird, and annoying. I have 2 monitors, my main which is ran from HDMI to HDMI and my second monitor which is ran from DVI to VGA. Everything in my pc is pretty up to date besides the graphics card.

AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Six-Core Processor 3.40 GHz

16GB DDR4 Vengeance ram

64 Bit Windows Home

I've reinstalled the Oculus software twice, updates my graphics card drivers, uninstalled them and reinstalled them, tried skipping the tutorial and going straight to SteamVR, which at that point, I was already stuck on the glitch screen after skipping the tutorial and couldn't seem to get it off the VR.

I've purchased this VR from a friend who I returned it to and they've since tested it and said it works flawlessly. This whole thing is just very confusing to me, if my GPU wasn't VR ready, then why did it let me run half of the tutorial before dying in the same spot?

I am brazilian and just got an Oculus Quest 2. I want to understand what options I have when buying games. Let me ask my question with an example: I see that the game Beat Saber is US $30,00 in the official Oculus Store (this is 162 BRL + taxes). However, the same game is available in Steam for 58 BRL (because of Steam\`s local pricing)

Is there a way for me to buy the game in Steam and then run the game natively on Quest 2? If not, what options do I have? Based on my research, my initial understand is that it would only be possible to run it via cable or wireless (that is, it would run in my PC, not natively). However, all posts that I found were pretty old.

I wanted to confirm what options I had with you guys before purchasing games in Oculus Store, given that they are really expensive for me. Another options that don't involve Steam would be nice as well!

I'm talking about image clarity and resolution of course and while it's clear that the G2 scores better in that regard, I don't know what to expect with the Q2.

I've never worn a VR headset before so I'm going in totally blind. I've been checking out some Through-the-lens videos and the only image quality that looks remotely acceptable, in comparison to high-end PC gaming, is the G2's. But so many people are saying that the Q2 is amazing. 

Is it really as blurry as it looks in those videos? I realize that putting a camera behind the lens isn't the same as wearing the headset, but since I have no idea what a decent VR headset looks like and no way of testing one, I am unable of visualizing it. 

Here's a video: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ny_OPsxHQmU?t=264https://youtu.be/ny_OPsxHQmU?t=264)

The G2 looks like 1080p while the Q2 looks like an upscaled 720p res with washed-out and inaccurate colors. Should I expect something like that? Or will my mind be blown when I wear the headset and all these little irregularities are only visible in a video? 

I'm planning on using it for PCVR gaming, by using a WiFi 6 AX hotspot from my ethernet-connected PC's network card. Will the compression add to what I'm ranting on about? I did some tests and the latency between my phone and the hotspot is 10ms, which I guess won't be noticeable, so I'm fine with that part.

I'm in no way an enthusiast but I've gotten used to playing every game in the highest settings possible and I don't want this to feel like a downgrade.

As I have stated earlier it was the same issue for all 3 headsets. When I go into a game, the game, or rather the headset, would crash after about a minute of game play. What I mean by this is after about a minute, the screen freezes on the headset for like 5 seconds and it follows your eyes when you move your head, which feels really weird, after that a loud static noise plays and the screen goes black. The game though is still open and running, so if I take off the headset and wait about 30 seconds then put it back on, the game starts to work again but unfortunately goes through the same cycle. There is also crackling audio on the headset at all times. Furthermore, I have access to a second VR capable computer and it has the exact same issues as well.

Support said let's switch to email, sent me an email, but then they don't respond to my emails. I googled the error messages and there are many people with this problem, but no solutions.

So I have been using a vr gun stock because it feels more comfortable and increases aim, however when I wanna reload it could make it difficult to attach the controller back onto the stock and dettaching, although  I have thought about slight solution to this, if i double tap on the left side of the headset it should turn the left lens into passthrough, vice versa for the left. This is so that i can have passthrough on one eye while maintaining vision on my other eye mid-game.

I think this should be a toggle-able setting though, as I see how this could be irritating. I know this is a suggestion not many people may agree with, but please dont argue about it with me, or anyone else because as I said, its just a suggestion. But I would be up for the conversation or debate.

I've been thinking about getting a VR-Headset for a very long time now and finally wanna commit to it and buy myself a Quest 2. I've decided on the Quest 2 cause it would be my first VR-Headset and I don't wanna spend too much money on something I don't know if I'm gonna use it a lot or not.

So I have some questions and would very much appreciate if you had an answer to some or possibly all of them. Im very grateful for any input.

1. How much more do I need to spend to play with my PC? So far I've seen that you can either just use a cable or use some Remote-Desktop app which also costs money. Is there any other way or are these the only 2 options? 
2. How good are both of these? Is the cable very disturbing when playing? Is there a big delay or other problems with the remote desktop solution?
3. What are some good and not too expensive solutions for full-body tracking? As far as I know hand-tracking is pretty easy to set up and doesn't require any extra costs?
4. Is it a good time to buy a quest? Im gonna wait for the 128GB version if its the same price as the 64GB one and apparently there's a recall going on because of some allergic reactions? Is there a new model coming out anytime soon that we know of and I should wait for?

a. Can do stuff while lying on your back

b. can make objects/things huge/3d potentially which should help for memory

2. After I watch a video, say on a biochemistry topic, I can't make an anki flashcard 
3. There's no good memory palace app for things like biochemistry or MCAT stuff, but memory palaces or 3d mnemonic videos (like picmonic/ pixorize) seem like they would be amazing for memorizing things 
4. There is no default pdf viewer and I don't feel like buying one, the current one looks meh. So the ability to read books while lying on your back with it is out, might as well use a gooseneck tablet stand

Many arguments are focused on Apple's and Google's mobile app stores, but it is described in the bill that computer devices also will be subject to this bill like the Oculus standalone headsets. If this bill was passed then there would Facebook would have to allow for those third party apps and app stores. Meaning that other stores will have to be supported on the Oculus platform like Steam.

When I do the same with AirLink the line appears 5/6 times, 2 at each end of the movement and 3/4 times more in between

I still have Oculus downloaded for some of the games I don't want to buy again, but when I check the Playtime it only gives me ""This PC Only"", which is 0 minutes since I have also built a new PC and factory reset it since I played the Oculus version.

I tried many things, such as.

\- Opening the command prompt and finding the oculus driver download thing and redownloading it. 

\- Taking out the usb/display port and plugging in the usb, waiting 10 seconds and plugging in the display port. (It recognizes the usb instantly, then recognizes the display port for 2 seconds before unrecognizing it for some reason)

\-Updating my drivers

\-Updating windows

\- Opening device manager and forgetting my oculus USBs and then  putting  them back in.

I love the oculus quest but Facebook is terrible now and the fact that they ban you on the Facebook app for menial things, means that you can’t even play your console or games that you paid hard earned money for. 

When I bought this device, I didn’t have to do all that. I didn’t have to merge my account with my Facebook account. Although, I don’t break any community standard rules on the app, I damn sure didn’t do it on the Quest as I don’t even communicate on there. I hardly even play multiplayer games on there. 

I have spent 400 bucks for this headset and probably 2-300 bucks on games. And I can’t use them because my account is banned for 30 days for simply replying to someone and they didn’t like what I said. And when I try to appeal the decision, Facebook pulls that Covid crap and they keep the decision the same. 

I’m asking 450 bucks because you will get games such as: 

Walking Dead
Population one 
Gorn 
Onward
Orbus VR 
Contractors 
Sairento 
Robo Recall
Espire 1 


The quest works perfectly. There are no defects. And I really want to keep it but as long as it’s tied to Facebook, I don’t want to continue supporting them. My stepson has been using it, but now he can’t because I’m banned. And I’m banned on a profile not even associated with the oculus account (crazy right).

2. I login to audible in the oculus browser and start playing an audiobook. I close my eyes and wish I could temporarily make the screen dark. How do I do this? 
3. How do I change the brightness of the screen? 
4. I search the store for anki. I can't find it. I just wanna do some flashcards while lying down hands at my side, totally relaxed. Can't. 
5. No problem, I put my books into onenote. Oh right, I can't open onenote in oculus quest 2
6. Alright w/e, I""ll just quickly switch between the youtube vr app and then check mightytext in the browser to see the text message someone sent me so I don't have to take off headset to check. Oh right, I need to close out of the youtube VR headset, losing my current video and current time stamp 
7. Lying on my back in bed, I put the controllers at my side. During videos, a pitch black colored version of the controller will briefly blip in front of me during the video. How do I prevent this? 
8. I lay my controllers at my side, holding each in my hand while lying on my back. The video is above me. I need to raise my arm to put it to the video in order to click on the video. Is there no other way? Can't leave arms at my side like a mouse that doesn't care where it is placed?

&amp;#x200B;

I find I don't use VR for VR, which I have not really enjoyed that much. But the ability to be able to stuff while lying on my back is great, especially when my body is very sore and I want to rest lying down. Any back or neck soreness built up from the day is just gone.

Hello Everyone;

I would like to introduce my latest game ""The Adventures Of Jack Jones"" in development for the Oculus Quest. I Started an Indiegogo for the project in hopes that I can hire a couple artists to help lift the pressure off my shoulders some as I am the solo developer / artist on the project.

Check it out here and lock in your pre-order at a discount and get some awesome stuff to boot for your early adoption / support: [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-adventures-of-jack-jones](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-adventures-of-jack-jones)

1. First of all i hate the blurry edges of the lenses, i know  and i've read that the technology is not there yet and that you have to keep looking in the middle and use your head to turn around instead but its so annoying. Or is the ""sharp view area"" on other devices better? 
2. Second thing i'm a little bit ""nearsighted"" but its really nothing dramatic i can still see the trafic signs pretty easily in a long distance. But in the quest 2 and i've also read about it that in the vr it's reversed, and it looks like its true, no matter how much i adjust my ipd or the position of the headset on me, everything that is like half an arm away from my head is super blurry. Any solution to this? Is it just the Quest 2 problem or it's my vision? or is it the case that your eyes are not trained to focus through the lenses on near objects that i ve also read on other subreddit?
3. Bluetooth headphones. This is a real disappointment. I got Beats by Dre Studio 3, JBL earplugs, and another sony headphones  all wireless, and i can't use any of these becouse of the sound delay, yeah its nice that you have a jack support, but what is it good for when you also cannot use headphones with a microphone, when i connect them only right speaker works.

* Everything has godrays - if there are no godrays there's a slight blur around it. Especially noticeable with white text on gray/black background. Way less prominent in gameplay.
* Lense circles with chromatic aberration are visible in darker scenes.
* I feel like there's a 'dull spot' on one the right lense. A small oval circle to the left of the center that seems less crisp.
* A very tiny 'sweet spot', about pea-sized. Looking just a little bit to the left/right/top/bottom and things git noticeably less sharp.

Hi, so I'm running into some problems with steam vr, I have an oculus quest 2 Which I connected using all different methods, Virtual desktop, air link, Oculus Link. All of them work fine both wired and over wifi with average 12ms. The problem I have is that Oculuses own software renders fine. But as soon as I run steam vr the resolution is extremely jaggered and low even inside of steam vr games. I tried changing it in steam vr settings but it doesn't seem to do anything apart from increasing latency. I tried changing it in oculuses software too with the same result. Any idea how to fix it ?

16gb 3000 mhz ram (I know its a bit slow for Ryzen but oh well)

I play using Ethernet with a 5ghz router with on average 800-1000 mbps download and 35-45 mbps upload speeds. As far as I know, My PC and internet should be more than capable to at least run my oculus home. My router is on my desk, in the same room as where I play VR (it's my bedroom, so I'd say its about 5ft from my headset when I'm standing up playing).

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, someone can help out and I'll be able to play at 1832x1920 as opposed to 1440x1600 (quest 1). I'm not certain is actually the same resolution as the quest 1, but it looks identical when swapping headsets. Also note: Low fps, low resolution, etc. occurs with the official oculus link cable that came out with the quest 2.

so any solution for that ?",True,False,False,oculus,t5_2uni5,371578,public,self,Playing Webxr games on vrporn.com with quest 2,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/optdll/playing_webxr_games_on_vrporncom_with_quest_2/,all_ads,6,,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'x9NCYPzbxqhGRAhiHJ-Sc6y1E0sng9GHIxt5WVuXweg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 61, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y3JN9khPWMMsX21zOKpejofw5wy2fkhg20reBOOQTR0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ea3bb8c3bf61b6c163249fcc741acdb0a380d5', 'width': 108}, {'height': 122, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y3JN9khPWMMsX21zOKpejofw5wy2fkhg20reBOOQTR0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae39bf280ae16a1180d36e53fdb9f5fd2cab579', 'width': 216}, {'height': 182, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y3JN9khPWMMsX21zOKpejofw5wy2fkhg20reBOOQTR0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a142c5e91ed16f11a83f2b7b02139b30acca9a18', 'width': 320}, {'height': 364, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y3JN9khPWMMsX21zOKpejofw5wy2fkhg20reBOOQTR0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=419a0e2e4ffa066a9ec34861dc9448515b5375f3', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 364, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Y3JN9khPWMMsX21zOKpejofw5wy2fkhg20reBOOQTR0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1848d873f6bcf73e02f123d36df51a60a59afb25', 'width': 640}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to check out my post and potentially help, I appreciate it!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm having a weird issue with my quest that I can't seem to resolve. I recently got a link cable (3rd party USB3.1 to C, 2.3Gbps on the test) that worked perfectly till a few days ago. I've been busy for a few days and didn't get the chance to play, in this time, there has been a windows update, and a few driver updates that I had to do on my laptop.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I plopped on my quest and wanted to play some HL Alyx, and link suddenly refuses to work. I tried with the provided cable as well (which worked before) with no success, so I'm pretty sure it's software-related. Whenever I try to activate link, I hear the windows disconnecting sound from my PC and the quest reconnects and link fails to start.

&amp;#x200B;

That is all the info I have, I do not get any errors and can't find any issues. I've tried different USB ports, tried repairing oculus(which reinstalled the app and took me hours as its 5Gb's and I have awful internet) and I'm still unable to access link.

My headset one day just lost tracking of my hands in the middle of a session. Restarting the game fixed it, but then every 10 minutes or so it would happen again. After a few days of this it stopped working altogether, now giving me the ""Sensors can't track Headset"" deal.

I've really tried everything to do with power management, USB 3.0, Oculus beta, reinstalling some drivers, wiping my C:, reseating the cable, all the other minor fixes.

This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/7qo1wk/bios_update_breaks_usb_for_sensors/) talks about the same issue, saying it was caused by XMP overclocking to their RAM. Reverting to stock fixed it.

I'm using the original oculus link cable for the quest 2, and I also tested its speed vial the Oculus app and it's at 3 Mbps. To test it, I also used the cable on my external SSD and it worked. ""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, after a long battle with the Oculus support (they were super helpful, friendly, and quick with their responses), my issue was that I had two graphics cards on my laptop and for some reason it switched to my integrated AMD graphics card.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Fix:**

Right-click on the Desktop and click  NVIDIA control panel, and then go to Manage 3D settings &gt; program settings.

1- click on Add.

2- find the OculusClient.exe then click on Add selected program at the bottom.

3- in the select preferred graphics processor section, use the High-performance Nvidia Processor and not the Global settings.

&amp;#x200B;

which should look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

if this doesn't work, in step 2 try clicking on a different Oculus program and also setting them to high performance, like the OculusDash.exe or the OVRServer\_x64.exe, and hopefully one of them will work.

So, before today I'd never used PC VR, or my Link cable I bought ages ago, took a while to getting round to it. The whole thing was pretty confusing and messy, let me start at the beginning. 

So with setting up the headset to the Oculus App, using the official Link cable on my Acer Nitro 5 laptop, I tested the connection and it passed, with a speed of 1.1GB/s or GHz, I can't remember, but it was 1.1, which seems pretty low to other results I've seen, considering it's the official Link cable, my laptop is no junker either, 6GB 1660Ti and 6 Core i5 or i7, I believe. 

The game I played was Fallout 4 VR, and that was through Steam VR, which was through the Oculus software. Set up didn't feel very smooth. Was also a couple things that made me wonder, like clicking the Oculus button that brings up the app I'm using, the icon was like a broken image and had no context. But it was working. Had no idea about anything in the Link home or Steam VR home, they were trying to teach me things I wasn't interested in, just wanted to play Fo4VR. 

So I play the game, almost instantly gives me a headache. Early on, I check the graphics settings and they seem to by default, be on some pretty high settings. I didn't know if my laptop was just good enough and they detected that, or if that was default for everyone. I lowered the graphics settings considerably to see if I'd get an increase in performance, but it was still very stuttery. After the opening scene and getting into the open world, I decided to put the settings back up, and once again, no difference, no better, no worse. 

It's hard to explain, it's not like the actually frame rate is bad, it just feels like something isn't quite right. Stuttery and disorienting, nauseating. Sometimes the move controller movement looked pretty fluid with not much noticeable difference, but sometimes the controllers themselves seemed to have bad FPS, the way they stuttered, but nothing in game was like that too. Also sometimes randomly, one of my controls would zip like 20 virtual feet ahead of me. Reminds me of a PSVR glitch where something is obscuring the controller or goes out of view of camera, but how is this happening on the Quest 2? Is it just that my speeds are garbage? Should I get a 3rd party USB 3.0 standard cable? I don't see how the official Link could be slower.

Normally this would happen after im in a game or when starting when it was in game my headset and controller positions got locked in place.

This never stopped the game either so the game was still running and moving and i could interact with the game still.

Share with the rest of the subreddit what games and experiences you've been enjoying recently.

How did you come across the game, what were your first impressions like, what did you like about it and most importantly, would you recommend the rest of us to try it or to stay away?  

Here are a couple of suggestions to follow when posting:

- Please put names of the games/experiences **in bold** for easier skim reading.

- Keep in mind that this is all about personal impressions and opinions so if someone didn't enjoy your favourite title feel free to discuss why but do so in a civil manner. No harassing someone for having a different opinion.  

- **Use spoiler tags** when discussing game's plot as to not ruin it for someone who hasn't played it yet.

- Upvote informative and well-written posts to encourage quality discussion.  
  
- Add a store link to the games.

I tried Chrome, Edge, and Firefox as well as the Oculus itself and used two different PayPal accounts and 3 credit cards all which have worked before and since.  I provided javascript console logs from all three browsers that clearly show the same java script errors when communicating to the corporate server.  

This problem started May 19th. But ticket 2857592 hasn't been responded to since June 2nd and it is July 4th. I tried Reddit over a month ago and they deferred to the ticket and hasn't followed up since.  I've tried other Oculus forms, chat (when available), another ticket  3003675 asking how to escalate this ticket, (which after a week has also not been responded to), and I am responding every day via email to the existing ticket. There doesn't appear to be an executive office that can be contacted like Amazon, Lenovo, and any other large company has.

I even tried contacting half a dozen Oculus staff via LinkedIn including the director of development out of Dallas.  They all either did not respond or said, ""Not my job"" in so many words.  No one referred me to a person or department that could help, despite that being the ask.  This shows a systemic problem in perception and concern for the customer.  

Clearly the hardware is being heavily subsidized.  Why is there no attention or thought put into how to support the platform especially for an emerging market?  At best this will lead to a disconnect with the evolving client base and at worse create the perfect platform for an eventual startup to swoop in and capture the market.  In my 30 years as an IT consultant this is by an order of magnitude the worst support I have received or consulted for from any company.

After weeks back and forth of simple obvious suggestions I already tried they can’t fix my Oculus that was hardly played and in mint condition. They responded with a summary of  “sorry your warranty is expired” here’s my response: 


This was purchased in November in 2019. Costs $400 dollars. A little more expensive than the purchase of a household console (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, PC) I’ve had gaming consoles for decades and they still function as normal. And their customer support is more professional and supportive than anything from Facebook Labs.

Never in my life have I ever dealt with such a terrible “welp it’s broken sorry” form of service. This is almost criminal. How can you expect a company as large as Facebook to just throw their hands up when something like this happens? I talked about getting one of these since before the developer kit came out. I actually still have it and that works still (just no support obviously). This is a faulty product. It’s in perfect condition, never dropped, never banged against anything, it’s clean, it’s been handled with care, in a case when it wasn’t played, the face guard never had to be changed because I didn’t want sweat to get in the fabric or smudge the lens. You don’t understand how careful I was to keep this in perfect condition.

Your support was the extent of “try to turn it off and on again” and “let me see what my manager says” for something that is 1 year and 8 months old? The 1 year warranty needs to be printed on the fucking box if you only expect it to last for that long. Maybe that’s the point I guess.

If you want to know why the other consoles and headsets will outperform you this is why. I’m sure the competition would eat these stories and terrible scenarios up. I’ll be staying away from oculus until they can resolve this part of their business. I’ll also be sending this out to anyone who wants to listen. This is awful. Not even an offer of a refund for the games I’ve purchased which are completely useless to me now since my headset is faulty.

People look at warranties and think, “oh sure the company wants to make sure that people who plan to run this into that ground can’t just turn around and get sent a new one” because I get it, a lot can happen in a year. 

But learning the reason why you have a one year warranty is abundantly clear. Your shit is faulty and you know it. I shouldn’t have purchased something that’s $400 with multiple games from a company that doesn’t give a shit and is just looking to try and squeeze themselves into a market through the power of social media.",True,False,False,oculus,t5_2uni5,369546,public,self,Oculus is broken and they don’t care,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/oi5xwy/oculus_is_broken_and_they_dont_care/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One thing I immediately thought about is how to use it for productivity. It would be great to use my keyboard and mouse but have huge screens in front of me that I could use like a real multi-monitor setup. 

With VR Desktop I can stream my monitor to the headset but its just one screen and also its kind of hard to use your peripherals with it because you cant see them obviously. Is there any workaround to make that happen? Can I somehow get multiple (virtual) monitors and use my keyboard / mouse with it?

There doesn’t seem to be a sub for this or a FB group even. It’s an amazing game.

I just bought it the other day and while it’s mostly responding well…sometimes when I go to throw the ball it glitches out and drops the ball during my throwing motion. Has anyone found a work around? Should I play as an older article said…by just throwing with the wrist? I don’t have any issues throwing in Echo so it’s not a hardware issue.

My wife got me a Quest 2 for Father's Day and I played all that weekend. (Well, as much as the battery would let me anyway.) I played Half-Life: Alyx (via Air Link) and Vader Immortal mostly, but never used smooth motion, only teleporting. I did try the smooth motion once and nearly fell over so I stopped.

The following weekend (last weekend) I got Skyrim and Fallout for Steam VR. Again, I tried smooth motion but this time I seemed to handle it fine in both of these games. I was a little nauseous but got over it quickly.

So Monday 6/28 comes around and I had the worst brain fog I've ever had. Thought it was due to something else so I played some Quest that evening.

Tuesday: more brain fog and extreme fatigue. The rest of the week, I came home every day at lunch and had to take a nap. On Friday, I took THREE 10 minute naps throughout the day. I had to pull a George Constanza and take two of them under my desk. Lol.

I felt drowsy yesterday and today but felt fine when I was ""in"" VR. It was only afterward that I felt weird again.

So I did some research and found out about **Sopite syndrome**:

""Sopite syndrome, which is a constellation of symptoms that involves apathy, depression, disinclination for work, and decreased participation in group activities, can occur. These and other neurophysiologic symptoms such as malaise, lethargy and agitation can persist for some time after the motion stimuli has ended."" ([Source](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2060606-clinical#b1))

I think this is *exactly* my problem. I'm wondering if anyone else here has gone through the same. It doesn't sound permanent but does sound like I'm not going to be able to handle VR in the long run... or smooth motion VR, at least.

I can't take being this tired at work anymore, so I'll ditch VR if I have to. Sucks that we just spent a bunch of money on the Quest 2, games, and I even bought Rx lenses so I don't have to wear my glasses, but it's effecting my performance at work so much it's not worth it.

Has anyone else here experienced this syndrome? I think I'm more prone to it because after being in a car for a long time on road trips, or even flying in a plane, it takes me a few hours to feel back to normal and like I'm no longer moving.

I've finally worked out how to actually record a side by side capture using Oculus Mirror and OBS, and that part is working great. But the problem is, when I play it back in a headset the eyes don't line up right. If you go a bit cross-eyed you can almost see it correctly, but clearly the offset is wrong for playback. Using Skybox VR I can tweak the settings up to an offset of ""0.5"" (whatever that means), but it still is not quite enough to make it comfortable to view.  It's kind of like the IPD is waaay off.

Installed my previous PC's GPU and hard drives (1060 6gb GPU), cloned the original PC's boot drive to the new m.2 boot drive, converted it to GPT and enabled full UEFI, booted, installed the new motherboard driver packages, and as far as I can tell everything is working - except Quest 2.

When I plug in the Quest 2, I get the USB connected device sound, followed by a little balloon popup that says ""USB device not recognized.  The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.""

All USB ports on the motherboard and on the case have been tested with both of my USB C cables and my cell phone, as well as with a USB 3.0 hard disk, and all are working.  I *do* have a USB C port on the back, but I don't seem to have a C to C cable that is capable of data transfer (of the three C to C cables I have, when I connect them to any USB C device, they just transfer power), so I don't know if that will help.  BUT I believe this to be a software problem anyway.

So, both cables work with different devices on this PC.  Both cables work with the Quest 2 on a different PC.  The Quest 2 works on a different PC.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the Quest app, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the ADB drivers, and I'm presently in the process of trying uninstalling all of that, again, cleaning out everything Oculus related in %APPDATA% and friends and in the registry, as well as a SFC /SCANNOW and a DISM.

So far, nothing useful has happened.  No changes.

I need someone to let me know what's been going on with Oculus lately. I'm quite paranoid at this point. I really want to get the Quest 2 because I've been making friends And my current friends have got me out of my social anxiety. Etc in VR chat. I've been using my brothers Rift S. My main question is since v30 came out for the Quest and Quest 2 I heard neat features came out on top of that I'm more concerned about ads in video games but I would like to play games when im not on my PC. Etc. If that makes sense. Like VR chat etc. I was wondering should I get the 299 headset or save for the $400.00 headset? Has anyone who played games had issues with ads yet or how does it work? Like if you buy a game for example in the Oculus store will the ads be inside the game while your playing a video game like Beat Saber etc? Or Waltz of the wizard or Minecraft VR? Just needed some advice is all. I'm scared to buy a Quest 2 at this point but I was wondering if I should get one or not. Plus I'm getting sick of the Rift S cable wrapping around my chair so Im loving how you can use air link to stream movies from aps on your phone to Big Screen and use air link to play steam games too. Any advice to help me out would be appreciative. If I do get the headset can someone recommend me any accessories I should buy? I would like to watch movies and anime in VR and spend hours of gameplay in VR and I need a good soft elite strap and grips and face cover for sweat and comfort. ^_^ Thank you. :),True,False,False,oculus,t5_2uni5,367537,public,self,Should I still get an Quest 2?

I've tried re-installing with all of support's suggestions.  I updated Windows, my AMD driver, disabled all programs, disabled game mode, etc. before booting into safe mode to uninstall, and then boot back normally to reinstall and connect.

Here are a few things i was wondering for anyone that owns a Quest 2.  

Does plugging in the Quest 2 allow you to use your PC's storage and does it also increase graphics quality etc.

Does the Quest 2 have the same graphic quality/Resolution as the Rift S when plugged into a PC.

When plugged in is the Quest 2 just outright better than the Rift S comfort aside.

I've been tethering my Quest 2 to my pc to play rift games etc. and noticed that I just don't get the performance I was expecting. I want more consistent high framerates at higher settings in the current and upcoming generations of games, and am waiting to grab myself a RTX 3080 if they ever restock. With that in mind I think I am and will be facing a bottleneck with my CPU, I have noticed its poor performance on a variety of games including Blade and Sorcery, vivecraft, Pavlov VR, H3VR, Skyrim VR (heavily modded).

I am considering a narrowed selection of CPUs, namely: Ryzen 5 5600X, Ryzen 7 3700X, i9-9900k, i7-10700k, and the i7-11700k. All with the exception of the i9 would require purchasing a new motherboard, which I am not opposed to (and would also love some advice on as well).

Solutions I've tried:

Tried several different USB cables A-&gt;C, C-&gt;C and various ports on my PC. Not sure if it's related to the problem, but the Oculus app always gives me a warning that a USB 3 connection is recommended (even though I have tried every port and orientation with many of the USB 3 slots on my mobo). I don't have the official cable or link, but from what I've read it shouldn't matter.

Flashed bios. I noticed the latest bios update for my mobo (X570 tomahawk) mentioned updated compatibility for USB devices. Unfortunately, this did not help.

My current (default ISP) setup is my PC connected via ethernet to my main (5GHz) router and that's pretty much it.

I did the best I could do with the research and the best solution I can come up with is the following:

-Buy a TP link AV600 powerline adapter and plug one of the ends downstairs directly within my living room.

-Buy a Tenda AC10U wireless router, connect it to the powerline adapter and configure it as an access point.

this is Sebastian from MRTV. I have had the Focus 3 for a couple of days now and it is about time to let you know about my first impressions of the device. 

This is not a full write up, you will get that for the full review. It is simply a link to my video, so if you are interested in it, and I am also showing you the home environment in this video, please have a look:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pHIGHeU3j8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pHIGHeU3j8) 

I have also included time stamps, so you could simply jump to the part that interests you the most. 

For a very short summary: 

Pros: 

\-Incredible Build Quality

\- Sleek Look

\- Great balance, good comfort

\- Exchangeable batteries, perfect for location based entertainment

\- Fantastic panels, intensive colors, great contrast, no SDE

\- Tracking is so good, even better than Quest because bigger tracking volume - they NAILED it

\- Controllers just as good as Oculus Touch

\- PCVR Streaming via USB cable works really well

\- wider horizontal FOV

Cons: 

\- Fan Noise

\- Wireless PCVR Streaming still in beta

\- Godrays

\- Small sweetspot

The exercise I subscribed to, Netflix, Virtual Desktop.

VR has come a long way with the Oculus Quest 2. No eye pain, headaches, motion sickness, even after hours.

The device is affordable too, which I hope brings more companies to make content for the system. VR is about to explode.

CPU \~ intel i5-6500  
GPU \~ Nvidia RTX 3070  
RAM \~ 16 GB 2133mhz  
Game installed on a 1TB HDD  
Headset \~ Quest 2 connected to pc via airlink

I know that my CPU is a bit of a bottleneck but I do not think that it can be the problem of this much lag.

When I play beat saber, everything is fine and I have no lag. This changes in Half life: Alyx. In the menu everything is fine apart from it saying that I have ""low GPU memory"" availible. I find this odd since I have a brand new 3070. When I get in the game though, everything seems to go wrong. It does render correctly when I have my head stationary, but once I start moving it stutters a lot.

The Getting to Know the controllers demo and the Robot in a junk room demo. But as soon as the Oculus Home tries to launch I get the White and Grey grid Horizon, an Oculus Logo then blank.

I can keep trying and it will load into the Home scene, with the pirate ship out of the window but crashes after 2 seconds and no menus load up.

I've tried iRacing (which will be my main use) which over the years I've used with no problem on my RIft. However, this detects the headset, loads up in VR mode but nothing appears on the RIft display.

On my monitor I can see that it's in VR mode and the headset tracking IS working (move the headset, see the movement on my monitor).

Both PCs behave in the same way.

My main rig is a Ryzen 5 5600x with RTX3080

My 2nd rig is an Intel i5 4690k with GTX 1060. I thought it would be an issue with the newer RTX3080 but clearly its something else.

Could it be a firmware update has broken my RIft?

I've already tried changing power management settings and update drivers for both usb and gpu. My headset won't turn on again until I unplug the usb and plug it back in.

I posted here a few days ago about getting a headset for Elite Dangerous and some posters kindly steered me in the direction of the Quest 2.

It's arrive, and I have a fairly good quality USB-C cable for it - only I'm a dummy and forgot my PC doesn't have a USB-C socket.

Am I ok to connect it with an adaptor such as this:

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Female-Adapter-Nimaso-Sides-Charging-Black/dp/B07QMLTQ53/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=usb+c+to+usb+3+adapter&amp;qid=1624141591&amp;sr=8-4

?

Also, this may be really stupid, I kinda figured it would plug into the graphics card?  A few years ago my friend got the original Rift and I seem to remember a load of cables coming out of that.  Does the Quest 2 simply go via the USB cable then?  I take it graphics card sends the data as a stream to the Quest via USB?

Thank you!

EDIT: also just some random screaming into the wind feedback - whilst I realise it's a FB product and thus expect privacy invasion all over, the setup is a ball-ache.  Admittedly I wanted to set it up on a separate FB account than my own, but setting that up, linking them all and installing the fb app and verifying all the stuff took a couple of hours.  The device itself was easy to figure out and quite intuitive, but seriously, the signup process is very annoying.

I've been using the same HP WMR headset for a good year or 2 as I wanted to experience VR at home but didn't have the money for a Rift or the space for base stations.
However I've wanted to experience VR a bit better for a long time now, and thought now would be a good time to bite the bullet and  buy a new headset as I have 3 months to myself. 

The Quest has been removed from my list as many of my friends have had problems with connecting them to theIR PCs and I don't like the idea of having to charge my headset (I do know you can use wired but I'd be worried of ruining the USBC port by accident). So I've decided a Rift S would be great as I would get inside out tracking and it's wired.

I've searched on eBay and have found a Rift S for £140, headset only. This would be great as I love the WMR controllers and, even if it did come with controllers, would immediately try and use them with the headset. It's also great as it's cheap and is definitely in my price range. 

Now Id assume this wouldn't be possible out of the gate, but has someone made a mod that could make this possible? I've looked all over Google and haven't found anything to support this so I've decided to ask here.

When I am playing VRChat, usually between 20 minutes to an hour, the headset will start stuttering, crashes within a few seconds and completely shuts down (the orange light comes on the headset and it goes dark). The Oculus app restarts (the icon pops up) but I am unable to launch anything from there as it attempts to but never launches (SteamVR is the first thing I open). Throughout this whole thing, the audio from whatever VRChat world I was in (+ voices or discord calls, if I'm in one) keeps playing, no matter what.

I made sure that all USB power options are off and unchecked any boxes that give my PC permission to turn off the port, including trying all DisplayPorts and USB ports. I repaired and then did a clean reinstall of the Oculus app, making sure that it's all up to date. I also update my GPU drivers as soon as they release - same with Windows updates. I tried going straight through the Oculus app and hitting the Restart under Settings &gt; Beta but it really doesn't do that because the audio just keeps playing. It only ever really resets if I unplug the headset and replug it but I found that if I do that, the next time it crashes even sooner. Usually I have to restart my computer and set it all up again.

Most posts I've seen were something related to an antivirus permission (doesn't apply to me) or some Razer software (which I do not have). I'm a bit iffy about purchasing a standalone USB 3.0 Hub since I've read that it fixes the issue for a little bit until it eventually breaks again. 

This issue happened about a year ago as well and a friend messed with some settings and fixed it (I'm not entirely sure what it was). I stopped using the headset for about 5 months and now when I came back, it worked perfectly fine for a couple days until it started happening all over again.

Virtual Learning Lab from University of Copenhagen developed a virtual reality experiment focused on behavior sustainable for nature! The simulation will be presented **in Oculus Quest, or as a desktop application** (you will not know which version you will get before starting the experiment).

You can participate if:

● **you currently live in the USA**

● you have access to an Oculus Quest (1 or 2). Only one participation per device.

● you have not already installed and completed the ""SustainabilityVR”

● you are at least 18 years old.

The first part of the experiment will take you approximately 30 minutes to complete (15 minutes for simulation and 15 minutes to fill pre and post questionnaire). **One week later** we will send you a follow-up questionnaire which will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.

If you complete the study, we will reimburse you with an Amazon gift card worth $10. If you fill out a survey sent to you **1 week after participating**, we will give you $15 instead. You will receive your gift card in one month after participating.

You can start the experiment through this link

After completing the pretest survey, you will find a link where you can download either the Oculus Quest version or desktop version (for Mac or Windows). The version of the simulation will be randomized. After completion of the simulation, you will be asked to finish the survey on your computer.

The study, its procedures, and data policy have been ethically approved by the relevant board at the University of Copenhagen.

I'm a brand new VR user who has two weeks to develop a workflow for a NASA-sponsored summer camp in the middle of nowhere in Appalachia.

We will be using 4K cameras to take burst shots of impact craters made by dropping objects onto an imitation lunar surface. Those strips of photos will be turned into a 3D model using photogrammetry and Agisoft Metashape. I am a hobbyist-level 3D modeler and game developer, but brand new to VR.

My main questions (and, after spending 6 hours messing with a Quest 2 last night, my concerns) are all centered around the headset. I already own a high-quality USB C cable, so I battled with Oculus Link and my PC for half of that time, not even realizing why the Link Home and the standard Quest 2 Home are separate...if this gives you an idea of my experience level with this stuff.

**I believe that I've figured out the following:**

* The school purchased licenses to BrioVR, but it seems to me that this requires a PC and Oculus Link to view with a Quest 2.
* The school doesn't have access to gaming-grade PCs, so we'll have to use the Quest 2 Home, setting up our headsets with iPads.
* The school doesn't need to purchase expensive USB C cables.
* We will need AA batteries, microfiber lens cleaning cloths, and tech-safe sanitization procedures.

**But I still have a lot of questions and would really appreciate your help:**

* It seems to me that the Oculus Link/PC functionality is more advanced (but maybe it's just the interactable Link Home that gives me this impression). Will we be able to find an easy way to view custom 3D models/environments, exported as textured .fbx files? Some kind of ""model viewer"" software? They had purchased BrioVR for this, but it seems to me that it won't work without an Oculus Link-capable computer (the best they have are some mid-power laptops).
* I would love to let the students move around their craters in VR, but this seems too complex for the time I have. Am I correct in thinking the best idea is to find a ""3D Viewer,"" or is there some obvious solution I'm missing?
* Are there any awesome, free, science/space themed VR experiences you'd recommend for downtime?
* Will we be able to lock down the Quest 2, preventing students from viewing and downloading unwanted content/games/sites?
* **Million Dollar Question:** each team will have their own tasks, projects, and headset. I don't want kids logging in with their own Facebook accounts, nor do I want to use any staff member accounts...so how on Earth am I going to get these Quests ready to go but also anonymous? Is there some kind of educational Facebook account I can create? (Sorry for this luddite question - I am one of those people who never logs into Facebook and would delete my account if it weren't for a few friends and family members).

When using Steam VR the image warps a lot when moving my head around, mainly when tilting side to side

This is 100% software problem, its only steam VR, in the virtual desktop on my PC is perfectly fine, its only when i boot up a game or go into the steam VR home

I have opened a game and then switched back to the desktop view (still in VD) and the image is not warped, so I believe it is an issue on the oculus rendering side by the time its fine on the desktop

&amp;#x200B;

FWIW its also lagging a lot, even on 60fps on medium/low settings

System specs are:

MSI 3070 suprim

AMD 5600x

16gb RAM

I have updated the NVIDIA drivers and both the VD app on the headset and the streamer app too, the headset itself is up to date too

&amp;#x200B;

I have played the same game (pavlov VR) through the link cable and its 90fps on ultra everything, so it cant be a hardware issue on my PC

Before I dive into the issue here are my specs: 
AMD Ryzen 5800x
32gb RAM
AMD 6700XT
NVME SSD

Issue started about 3 days ago when I noticed awful studdering,  and latency issues with virtual desktop after it was working just fine the previous day.  I switched to Air link with no change in the issue.  I have Ubuqiti 5 ghz access points so I logged into the controller and kicked everyone off of the AP my quest was connected to with no change.  But I did noticed in Virtual Desktop that there was a very high encoding latency. Which is making me lean towards a driver or software issue.

So I moved on and purchased a link cable to eliminate my network.  It is being recognized in the oculus app as 3.0 with 2.5 gb speed.  When I launch VR chat I get  unplayable studdering and screen tearing.  I noticed that my GPU is hovering around 20% utilization instead of 80 to 90 percent like it used to with virtual desktop.

Things I have tried so far:
Reinstalled steamvr and used default graphic settings,
Reinstalled SteamVR games,
Reinstalled oculus software with default graphic settings,
Updated GPU drivers,
Factory defaulted the quest,
Unplugged second monitor (saw on another forum post that could help),
Probably more I forgot by now.

The GPU still sits around 20% utilization none of these I tried so far had any affect.   This is making me lean towards a possible GPU driver issue or something I am setting up wrong in oculus or steam.  I have not tried a fresh install of W10 with just steamvr and oculus yet but wanted to see if anyone else had any ideas before I go that far.

I loved using my Rift S for about a year for flight simulators and it works perfectly. Recently switched to a Reverb G2 so I am looking to sell the Rift S. Tried to choose a price a little below what I saw on eBay so someone in the gaming community can get a good deal on a good headset.

The Rift S works perfectly and I never had any problems with it. There is some electrical tape on the cable where my puppy bit the cable once, but that damage did not affect the headset’s functionality whatsoever. Used it for months after that happened with no problem.

The headset comes in its original packaging and with both controllers. Controllers work.

So after unending issues regarding pairing my headset, it took 2 weeks of communication the after the day the headset arrived to get a replacement. This replacement fixed one issue, however there were still other issues that I just had to troubleshoot to fix each and every time I started using the headset. 



From then, the headset worked okay enough with several work arounds and 3rd party software and hardware. Next, about 1 month before my warranty ran out my right joystick went out, always reading as turning right, with no visable physical damage. Naturally I contacted support to try and get the controller replaced while within the 1 year warranty. I had to open 3 tickets during this time, the first was quickly abandoned, after the agent sent the infamous paragraph of troubleshooting steps that they send to any issue that they can't resolve. When I realized they weren't watching that email anymore I opened another, where after sending the same paragraph of steps they still remained on the ticket. They asked for videos of the incident, even mentioned that my warranty only had two weeks on it so we needed to go fast then, after sending in logs for 3 different sessions, that operator also abandoned the ticket. At this point I tried to open another ticket in time, but the chat operator said I already had a open ticket ( the one they weren't responding to). And in these last two days of warranty I was not able to even get in contact with Oculus. 



In this time I was still able to play games like Blade &amp; Sorcery or Beat Saber, those not requiring a turn control, and I gave up on getting a replacement. Well, of course the right controller just stopped pairing aswell. And considering I already spent 400 dollars on this device I couldn't warrant having it be useless, and there is no alternative in the market so my only option was to give Facebook another 70 dollars for another controller. Well, of course after placing the order on the 18th I've still not received my controller that had a ETA of June second, in fact they never even sent the damn controller. Opening yet another chat with Oculus they stated that there was ""a problem with the order"" and refused to elaborate and opened another ticket. I'm halfway scared they will make me troubleshoot my headset to see why the controller hasn't shipped yet. 

So yeah, if you are thinking about ordering from ""Oculus"" I would just keep in mind that they don't care at all about the consumer, and will just fuck you over because they have no competition.

I'm having the same issue I've seen others having with my new Quest 2. It used to not be this way, however it has gotten worse after an update around Christmas.   


I'm a music producer and am VERY protective of my hearing. I carry two sets of earplugs with me on my keychain just because I never know when I'll end up somewhere loud. I know this isn't an issue with my ears. Ever since this update, using headphones or even the headset regardless of the app used, minimum volume and max volume is hardly even a 3db difference. Occasionally I can mess with the quick menu and the volume will suddenly be louder like it used to be, but no actual fix. I can be in bigscreen, vr chat, alt space, rec room, any app honestly and the volume at Max is literally too low to even hear someone next to you. This is the same with headphones, and its the same without. It's incredibly frustrating that this used to be a non issue, but now it's ruining my experience with my Quest. My girlfriend has another quest 2 and she doesn't have this issue. I also have a Quest 1 and don't have this issue either.

Since I want to play PCVR and don’t want to rely on solely wireless, I want to buy a cable to connect my the headset to my PC, but the official one costs 90 euros which is overpriced in my opinion. I want to buy a cable that can connect to my computer using USB-A since it doesn’t have a USB-C jack. Any good recommendations?

Lastly, if there is anything else I don’t know about that may be useful, please let me know.

AGENT (R Jay): Hello there 
AGENT (R Jay): Thanks for reaching out to Oculus Support 

USER: My oculus quest started recording and saving that data with no permission 
USER: this is unacceptable 
USER: voice command service is not something I turned on 
USER: and it’s been keeping and storing my voice data 

AGENT (R Jay): I understand that your Quest is randomly recording and storing that input which is unauthorized. Let me see what I can do for you here. Our ticket number is 2887450. 
AGENT (R Jay): This issue is unusual and it's probably due to a software issue. 
AGENT (R Jay): Do you recall dropping or impacting your Quest against something? 
AGENT (R Jay): That must have messed up something within the device and caused a malfunction on some functions. 

USER: No, dropping a quest has fuckall to do with a feature being turned on. This wasn’t a glitch, it’s a mistake on the company’s part. 
USER: I want to speak with a person by phone 
USER: Before I decide to get a lawyer 
USER: Can you refer me now? 
USER: Hello? 
USER: presence message 

AGENT (R Jay): We currently don't have call services. We can assist you as just with chat. 
AGENT (R Jay): Have you actually tried to disabled voice command? 
AGENT (R Jay): Voice command is automatically enabled the first time that it is set up. 
AGENT (R Jay): If you want to disabled voice command, please follow the steps here outlined in the image below: 

USER: presence message 
USER: My app glitched sorry 
USER: just got ur messages 
USER: You don’t get it, I don’t want to simply “turn it off” 
USER: my issue is that you guys are taking my private information with no permission 
USER: I never turned on voice commands and it’s just doing this now 
USER: Why can’t you guys answer a phone anyway? 

AGENT (R Jay): That is not our intention. Probably you have said something to trigger voice command, like ""record"". 

USER: Is that not crappy customer service? On top of that, it shouldn’t have ready any voice commands in THE FIRST PLACE 

AGENT (R Jay): We are aware that some services are available for calls, but we currently don't have call services. 
AGENT (R Jay): It'll be easier in context since we provide troubleshooting steps that can be tedious sometimes for our users. 

USER: I’m not “some users” I’m very good with technology. On top of this what you’ve told me is “it’s your fault”, “it turns on automatically”, and nobody is available by phone to report this to. I need you to push this to a higher up. 
USER: No tech support needed. 

AGENT (R Jay): Of course, I'll transfer you to a higher up but it may take a day or two before you get a response from them. Would that be alright? 

USER: That’s perfectly fine. 

AGENT (R Jay): Alright. I'll be sending you an email follow-up right after our chat session so in that way, we can reach out to you any time. So before I let you go, is there anything else that I could do for you? 

USER: No that’s it for me, thx 
USER: Wait 
USER: i gave a fake email at the start because I didn’t know why you’d need it 
USER: its (removed for privacy) 

AGENT (R Jay): Alright. Thanks for that. But we can only reach out to the email that you used to contact us initially. In this case, I'll send the email to 'bobschneider@gmail.com'. 

USER: That’s not good enough 
USER: Not even my email 
USER: and that’s not true, just input my email 

AGENT (R Jay): Alright then. I'll be closing this chat now. Thanks for chatting with us today. Bye for now and have a great day. 

USER: You’re fucking useless 
USER: and retarded 
USER: go fuck yourself 
USER: I’ll be saving this chat code

The past months I've been working on a game. I think the idea is quite neat. You sit on the ground, occasionally walk around and build you town/city in VR. Just like in your childhood with lego castles or any other fantasy toys.

I'm working part-time on this because I have to sustain the house my late parents left behind - still paying the bank. So, much energy goes into that. I know from experience that dividing your time on two projects is suboptimal. I was thinking about trying patreon, to give all my time to the game. What do you guys think?

Sorry for the delay. Now to the game. I was imagining it as a game like Settlers and Black&amp;White. You gather followers and with that faith to unlock new hexagons (because it is the bestagon).  You have to defend against intruders with fortifications, but you can also throw them you into the universe. The room you paint for the oculus is as large as the hexagon. So you can move on one freely. To the others you can port.

*Processing video 9lacx5ipdu371...*

The first buildings will be built by putting trees into the wooden frame. Later the followers will collect the wood by themselves. As resources, there will be wood, food, stone and faith (for now, more will come). Tell me please if you like it.

I don't have much skill or confidence in my skills. I'm stumbling from one problem into the next and finding a solution takes ages. For example, I want to have a bumpy terrain with hills and lakes. But the player will plant the buildings on the hills. How do I flatten the area under the building in real time? I have some solutions in mind and I will try them, but I need more time for that.

And then comes the promotion. I suck at this hard. I can't sell my product as the best there is. I was not raised in that way and I know there are better things out there.

Overall worked well though.

Since Air Link was released, I have been using it as my only method of playing any VR game. I was expecting some latency / performance issues but so far it has been absolutely perfect. I mostly play Beat Saber (around expert difficulty) and there is no noticeable quality / latency difference between Air Link and ""normal"" link over USB C.

You see, when I the plug both cables and checking the oculus app, the  headset turns the white light and the green checks appear. But when I  put on the headset on with the white light, it either shows nothing or  the three dot.

Also, even tho sometimes shows the two controllers showing on the  oculus app with the batteries power and all, the controllers doesnt turn on nor connects  with the headset. As far as im aware. this happens when  the headset is  not turn on, despite having the white light on and the checks green.    And then couple of seconds later. the orange light appears and either  the USB or the DP cable check turns into an red X.

My  brother also have this issue when using the headset on his PC (which is  recently new), and we  have thought that the headset is having an issue  and not our computers as we thought. We tried things like disintalling,  repair the oculus app, turn on beta, updating our GPU, oculus drive  and, deleting the RIFT S from the device section. Didn't work.

Also  talking about deleting the headset from  the device, I was going  through some stages of the  steps on setting up the rift s, and when i  plug the two cables on, it took longer to recognize the cables, so I  close the app and go back on, and it let me go to the next step.  (probrably should wait longer ig). In the next step said that the app is  going to recognize the USB cable, in which doesn't recognize despite  plug on.

But I remember when first experiencing the issue, I thought  it was my controllers not working  properly, but i also see my headset not woking as well. When I delete  the controller and then setting them  back in, on the oculus app on the steps of setting them back, the controllers turn on normaly. Couldn't say the same with the headset.

Share with the rest of the subreddit what games and experiences you've been enjoying recently.

How did you come across the game, what were your first impressions like, what did you like about it and most importantly, would you recommend the rest of us to try it or to stay away?  

Here are a couple of suggestions to follow when posting:

- Please put names of the games/experiences **in bold** for easier skim reading.

- Keep in mind that this is all about personal impressions and opinions so if someone didn't enjoy your favourite title feel free to discuss why but do so in a civil manner. No harassing someone for having a different opinion.  

- **Use spoiler tags** when discussing game's plot as to not ruin it for someone who hasn't played it yet.

- Upvote informative and well-written posts to encourage quality discussion.  
  
- Add a store link to the games.

Maybe you're affected yourself, maybe you only know someone who is.

For me, the Rift S Microphone situation got so bad it literally gave me social anxienty.

I meet someone in VR Chat? They tell me to f\*\*k off because my mic is so horrible I rape their ears.         
I wanna play Phasmophobia with others? Again, they all kick me because I sound like Glados inside an iron lung having a stroke. Noone wants me in their Echo VR team because noone can understand me. And if they can, they insult me because my mic is so **HORRIBLE**.

And after some time, this affects me more than i'd like to admid.

Lets be real ... this just sucks. **This shouldn't be be acceptable for a 400$ product**. 

I went trough so much trying to get this to work. But as many others, nothing helped... Reinstalling Oculus, changing the USB-Port, trying many different In&amp;Over-ear headphones, the problem always stayed. Just search on Youtube and you'll see all the fu\*\*ed up things people tried to fix this.

At some point just I taped a 3 meter AUX-cable to my Oculus cable, ductaped it to the headesets side and voila ... I could talk to people. Finally, success. But as someone who already despised the cable and just waits for a real wireless PCVR-Headset, this double cable situation only put more stress to the Headset, making fast turns&amp;stuff really uncomfortable.

I also didn't want to accept the fact that the only way I could enjoy my 400$ VR Headset is by just bypassing its functions and custering it with Tape.

&amp;#x200B;

**Facebook is 100% aware of this and I bet they could fix in in a small Hotfix... but they won't.**         
*Because F U! Buy the new Headset every Year or go to Hell you poor peasant.*

**So I bought wireless earbuds &amp; a 10$ bluetooth dongle ...** Why didn't my dumbass think of that before?

[Quibi somewhat back from the dead as Roku acquires their content for 2021](https://blog.roku.com/quibi)

- Quibi, created by Dreamworks co-founder Jefferey Katzenberg, was a service where you watched short films that were in ""quick bites"" (hence, Quibi). I think some of the longer ones would span multiple 10-minute episodes (Part 1, Part 2, etc). 

Problem was, you could only watch these film shorts on your phone. People wanting to watch these high-quality shorts on their nice TV -- no luck, phones only. And the timing of the release was bad, as the 2020 pandemic meant people would rather watch Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ than mess around with this Quibi, which was also marketed poorly.

But seeing that VR180 is *way* more immersive and engaging than 2D or any small phone screen, I would love a Quibi-type service on Quest or Steam that created film/TV shorts with some big name stars. Since Roku owns them now (the Quibi page has no contact info anymore), it seems you can contact Roku and let them know in case you want to see some VR180 stuff. I'll drop them an email too.

Can we get some VR180 content in this house? Content is a little dry here in this category. Going on YoutubeVR, there's hardly any new stuff.

I wanted to just stop by and say what a positive experience I have had playing my Quest 2 with Airlink.

Before update 29 virtual desktop worked but it certainly wasn't perfect.  I havent tried Virtual desktop after the update, but I did use airlink a few minutes ago, and managed to play beat saber, blade and sorcery and a little bit of H3 (the latter didnt work so well, I need to learn the controls with the quest 2 controllers) and I gotta say I dont have the best PC, nor the best internet speeds (i'm in the UK) and my god did it work so well, it was a joy to play.

I'm asking because a month ago, my third Quest 2 headset has died on me. I'm trying to see if this is an incredible strike of bad luck or something else. I received the first one on Oct. 26th 2020. Oculus has replaced it twice since. Understandably, this third dead one is puzzling them as much as me. I've been through all the resuscitation scenarios. As with the two previous devices, the screen is just dead. Not displaying black pixels. Simply not being powered at all.  


My usage is generally divided in two. Development with Unreal 4 for my master's, let's say for 85% of the total usage time. The remaining 15% is Fit XR training (with a silicon eye mask cover to avoid soaking the foam) and exploring various experiences (films, games or else) that the Oculus environment offers. I've always used the headsets indoors, in my office mainly.   


The first headset died (its display, to be precise, there still perceptible activity in the headset) while sitting on my desk and connected to my computer. I was cycling between Unreal work on the computer and testing in the headset.   


The second and third ones died (again just the display) while a short time after putting them on to do a gaming session standing. They went out after a few seconds.  


After going through the long email support routine for a third time starting on May 3rd, I was told that they were looking for a solution that would allow me to have a headset that would last more than a month. I was asked to be patient, but that was 28 days ago. They have not gotten back to me since May 11th. I tried 3 times to be updated on this case but I'm not getting answers anymore. The exchange has always been respectful.   


So, sorry for this long post, but I'm trying to figure how rare this specific problem is. I have no alternative and will probably need to buy a new net and start procedures to be refunded by BestBuy (the original seller of the headset). The general Oculus ecosystem is ok for what I'm doing. I'm not getting into the politics of the Facebook integration, it's irrelevant in the circumstance.

You see,  when I the plug both cables and checking the oculus app, the headset  turns the white light and the green checks appear. But when I put on the  headset on with the white light, it either shows nothing or the three  dot. 

Also, even tho sometimes shows the two controllers showing on the  oculus app with the batteries power and all, the controllers doesnt turn  on nor connects with the headset. As far as im aware. this happens when  the headset is not turn on, despite having the white light on and the  checks green. And then couple of seconds later. the orange light appears and either the USB or the DP cable check turns into an red X.

My  brother also have this issue when using the headset on his PC, and we have thought that the headset is having an issue and not our computers  as we thought. We tried things like disintalling, repair the oculus app,  turn on beta, updating our GPU, oculus drive and, deleting the RIFT S  from the device section. Didn't work

Also talking about deleting the headset from  the device, I was going through some stages of the steps on setting up  the rift s, and when i plug the two cables on, it took longer to  recognize the cables, so I close the app and go back on, and it let me  go to the next step. (probrably should wait longer ig). In the next step  said that the app is going to recognize the USB cable, in which doesn't  recognize despite plug on.

But I remember when experiencing the issue for the first time, I thought it was my controllers not working properly,  but i also see my headset not woking as well. When I delete the  controller and then setting them back in, on the oculus app on the steps  of setting them back, the controllers turn on normaly. Couldn't say the  same with the headset.

Restarted Quest  
Restarted PC  
Updated Drivers  
Set OVR\_Server to High Priority  
Disabled USB Power Management  
Disabled Adaptive GPU  
Disabled Intel iGPU  
Tried multiple different USB ports  
Tried disabling MSI Afterburner and RTSS

Among other things as well.

Nothing seems to fix the issue however. Any advice as to what going on would be much appriciated. My specs are as follows:

Core i7-10750H  
Nvidia RTX 2070 Super  
32GB DDR4  
Oculus Quest 1 using the recomended Anker USB 3.1 cord, getting around 1.4-1.9 GBps speeds

Oculus support has been of no use really just having me redo trivial steps, and constantly misunderstanding me. Any advice would be much appriciated, thanks.

I've been on weekly chats with Oculus support and they are friendly and quick in the chat to reply, however the response at the end are all the same:

""Please wait for Facebook to reply, it will be 3-5 business days"".

It's been over 30.

I wait patiently for any update and check several times a day, nothing gets sent to my inbox, spam, trash.

I created the Facebook account for the sole purpose of being able to use the Oculus.  At this point I've asked to move the Oculus account to another Facebook account, as I simply don't care about the Facebook account I only care about the games I purchased and being able to play them.  The response I got back was ""we can put that request forward to Facebook"".

Complaint #1: Poor sportsmanship ruins the majority of matches. In 80% of my games, at least one person quits the opposing team or my team in the middle of the match. Sometimes people genuinely need to leave which is fine, but that isn't why people are leaving. If my team gets ahead by as little as two points, people on the opposing team quit. Often they're in a party so it becomes a 4v2 or 4v1. People join on back fill and they quit too.  
  
This might be understandable if the game was recently launched, but it's been out since 2017. People have asked the developers (Ready At Dawn) to address this issue probably hundreds of times. I've personally discussed it with the devs on discord and they promised for years to try to resolve it. They haven't and it's significantly worse now.  
  
The solution that I proposed was the following -  
  
If a player exits a match early, mark it as a loss (they do this now) and lock the terminal, preventing the player from joining a new game until their previous match completes. This would still allow people to leave the game early for legitimate reasons without a serious punishment, and remove all incentive for players to leave early just because they're losing. Their options would be to continue playing, or sit in the lobby doing nothing.  
  
For reasons unknown, they never implemented this. They continue to allow players to quit every losing match they're in with zero repercussions.  
  
Complaint #2: They don't have a ping cap. Players in my games have had 600-900+ ping that's sustained for the entire match while my ping is 30. This results in an arguably significant advantage for the laggy player. I put my shield up, they still stun me. I block their shot, the disk teleports into the goal a second later. In the 90's, multiplayer games had strict ping caps and if you exceeded them mid-game, you were automatically kicked. If you got kicked an excessive amount, you would be banned. The reason for it was because laggy players ruins the experience for everyone. I understand that it's sometimes necessary to mix regions, but there should still be a reasonable cap of say 250 or 300. And in my experience it's not even people from other regions with high ping, it's people in the same region with bad internet.",True,False,False,oculus,t5_2uni5,360121,public,self,I've played 4000 games of Echo Arena.

Lately I've been seeing a lot of:

*""Is there a good amount of content for the price?""*

*""Dude, it's $15. Just buy it, you already paid $400 for the headset.""*

Especially this comment sparked my interest: *""This is like people who buy a $1000 phone but won’t pay 99 cents for an app because it costs too much.""*

Am I wrong when I say that a lot of these $10 - $25 games in the store have very little content, and some of them not very replayable?

When I first saw Job Simulator on YouTube back in 2016, I paused the ""let's play"" at 5 minutes and thought to myself ""This is so cool, I'm not going to watch any more of this - I want the entire experience for myself. This year I bought Quest 2 and played it... for 3 hours before I ran out of content.

That's  ≈ $7 an hour. Say you for instance buy GTA 5 on your PlayStation for $60 and play the entire story - that's 50 hours, $1,2 an hour, assuming you **rushed through the story**. Me, I suppose including a lot others have played Online mode for countless hours, and we're down at cents per hour at this point (even if you buy DLC's for hundreds of dollars).

I think it's understandable that some think twice before buying VR games, even though they spend $400 on the headset - *because a lot of the games are straight up rip-offs...*

**TLDR:** &gt;!Don't feel bad if you only own one or two good VR games, ps. there are a lot of good free ones :)!&lt;

This isnt a complaint, rather a querey/confusion.

I suffer from a rash on my brows and now lip (ew) which appeared when I got my Pre order Q2 (i posted about is somewhere on one of the VR reddits at the time.)

So, obviously when the admittance of this issue came up and a replacement of the faceplate was offered I, like many others applied as a) it hurts to use my quest b)I love VR

Well, it arrived today but its this bit of kit.

its not an ""oculus"" replacement rather a 3rd party. Any reason for this?

I \*do\* have one bugbear which is that the above set is \*not\* compatible with the quest glasses spacer which means i have to fork out more pennies if I want to play VR in focus.

That \*is\* irritating.

So, any concrete reasons for this?

I can speculate but I'd like to know (if possible) Oculus' reasoning and if theres a cheaper alternative to a spacer for a tenner (plus delivery and silly brexit import tax)
